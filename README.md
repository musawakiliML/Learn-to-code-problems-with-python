This repo contains my solutions to challenge problems in the book. I solve the questions for my youtube series titled:
    *Learn Python By Solving Problems*

**Learn to code by solving problems by Daniel Zingaro**


Each Notebook will deal with a specific chapter in the book, and also contains some other problems.
